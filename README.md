For this specific project, we were tasked with creating a clock for ChadaTach that allowed you to add hours, minutes, and seconds to a real time clock as needed.
I think within this specific project, I was able to spread out my code within necessary functions/parameters in order to do what wa required and place as little code in main as possible.
Along with this, I think being able to keep the code readable and easy to follow as standard practices go for was a strength as well. This will definitely be a must once I obtain my career within coding.
If there was anything I could improve, it would probably be simpler on the in-line comments. I always tend to go a little overboard and overwrite when explaining things, so this could be worked on.
I think writing the header was the most challenging to write simply because it was different from what I've learned from langauages such as python and java. I have never had to attach files to each other up
to this point, so that was a new experience overall. Refering to zyBooks to know what I was doing helped tremendously and I will likely continue to come back to zybooks multiple times as I continue.
I think the skills of spacing out code and improving readability will definitely translate into the real world and actual projects. Readability is a thing I would have to assume is one of the most important
concepts in writing actual code for clients, so making sure I keep up on that will be crucial.
Like I said earlier, making sure I spaced out all of my code by functions as well as including comments when necessary was what made this code readable the most. Being able to spread it out and make it easier
to read allowed me also to get a better look at it after writing and catch any other mistakes I may have left out previously.
